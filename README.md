This project is a way for me to have fun while experimenting with some (game / web) technologies.  
The general goal at the moment is a minimalistic roguelike web-game based in part on WebAssembly.  

# [Play Demo Now](https://spfaus.de/web-game)  
As this game is based on [WebGL 2.0](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl2) and [WebAssembly](https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm) it may not run on your browser.
