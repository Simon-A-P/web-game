# web-game
My turn-based arena rpg web-game  

## Goals
I want this project to be a way to have fun while learning and refamiliarizing myself with some web technologies and an opportunity to improve my workflow.  
I would like this to be a project that I finish, at least as a minimal implementation, as I see myself starting a lot of side-projects without ever finishing them. That being said, this is more about the journey than the final product.  
If everything goes well, this might end up being a nice portfolio project for myself.  

## Finished project
The idea for the finished project is a browser-based game.  
It is a turn-based rpg. The graphics are minimalistic and the environments are tile-based like classic roguelikes.  
Player inputs are taken via the keyboard and possibly mouse.  
In its most basic implementation it should have a peaceful environment (like a village) for stocking up on supplies and some sort of dungeon with enemies to explore for treasures and experience.  
Sound is optional.

## Expected difficulties
I might have to redo big parts of the project or go through multiple prototypes as I am not sure how to cope with the increasing complexity (or how to keep the complexity low) as the project grows. This is to be expected, as I intend to expose myself to new ideas, technologies, and tools along the way, that hopefully make for a better development process and final product.  
As I haven't done a lot of backend programming recently, I might struggle with the implementation of a lot of features which hopefully won't take the fun away and make for a good learning experience.
